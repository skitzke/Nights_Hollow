# Night's Hollow
In this repository, the product (game), start document, and the class diagram will be provided for grading.

To start the game, 
1. Clone this repository and use an IDE that works with the specific languages of HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
2. Run index.html and enjoy the wonders of animation and creation.

I personally spent a lot of time trying to learn this specific JavaScript library, Phaser js, but through complication of Phaser recently being updated from Phaser 2 to Phaser 3 it was challenging to find revelant information according to what i have planned initially.

Regardless, I hope you enjoy what I have tried to create.
